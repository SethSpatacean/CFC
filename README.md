# UC Irvine Radiological Laboratory - Image Data Analysis
Code within this repository will be related to performing image data analysis. The focus of this code will be to analyze results from patient data imported from Vitrea (Canon Medical) software. All data captured through coronary computed angiography tomography (CCTA). 
# Coronary Flow Capacity (CFC)
Coronary flow capacity refers to the ability of the coronary arteries to supply sufficient blood flow to meet the oxygen demands of the heart muscle, also known as myocardium. It is a measure of the overall functionality and health of the coronary circulation.
Coronary flow capacity is determined by several factors, including the integrity and diameter of the coronary arteries, the presence of any obstructions or narrowing in the arteries (such as in coronary artery disease), and the ability of the blood vessels to dilate and increase blood flow when necessary.
To assess myocardial function and identify precursors of coronary artery disease, various methods can be used to evaluate coronary flow capacity.
## Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR): 
FFR is a technique used during coronary angiography to measure the severity of arterial blockages. It involves measuring the pressure within the coronary artery to determine the functional significance of any narrowings. FFR values below a certain threshold indicate reduced coronary flow capacity.
## Coronary Flow Reserve (CFR): 
CFR is a non-invasive test that measures the maximal vasodilation capacity of the coronary arteries. It compares the blood flow at rest to the blood flow during stress (usually induced by medications or exercise). A reduced CFR indicates impaired coronary flow capacity, which can be an early sign of coronary artery disease.
## Stress Tests: 
These tests, such as exercise stress tests or pharmacological stress tests, are used to evaluate the heart's response to increased demands for blood flow. They can help identify areas of reduced blood supply and assess myocardial function during stress.
# Summary of Results
By assessing coronary flow capacity through these methods, healthcare professionals can evaluate the adequacy of blood flow to the heart muscle. Reduced coronary flow capacity may indicate the presence of coronary artery disease, ischemia (insufficient blood supply to the heart muscle), or impaired myocardial function. Early detection of these conditions allows for timely intervention and management to prevent further progression and potential cardiac events.
